# DLMDSML01 - Machine Learning

## Q & A - Sessions

### Introduction to Machine-Learning

### Clustering

#### Part 2

We analyze clustering algorithms from a theoretical perspective, starting with developing a concept of similarity measures, discussing metrics to measure the quality of clustering methods, until going into detail on different clustering techniques. Finally we discuss hierarchical clustering in detail.

### Regression

### Support Vector Machines

### Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods

#### Part 2

We deepen our understanding of random forest algorithms, namely how boosting trees work. After discussing an analytical example we go over to the scikit learn's implementation of boosted trees as well as most recent algorithms, like XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost.

### Genetic Algorithms

### Performance Metrics

We discuss how to evaluate the performance of a machine-learning algorithm, both for
supervised and unsupervised tasks.

the individual performance measures from the *sklearn.metrics* functions.   

### Recommendation Systems

We discuss the basic principles of how to implement recommendation systems. For the MovieLens dataset we build up a first, simple user-based collaborative filtering movie recommendation system.

### Multilabel Classification
